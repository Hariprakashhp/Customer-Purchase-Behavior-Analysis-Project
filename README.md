# Customer-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis-Project
Step 1: Problem Understanding

Businesses often struggle to retain customers and identify top-performing products.

My objective was to analyze retail sales data and generate insights that would help in customer segmentation, churn prediction, and revenue growth strategies.

Step 2: Data Collection & Cleaning (Excel + SQL)

I started with a retail sales dataset that contained customer details, transactions, and product information.

Using Excel and SQL, I:

Cleaned missing or duplicate records.

Transformed data into structured tables (Customers, Products, Transactions).

Extracted KPIs like total sales, purchase frequency, and product categories.

(This shows data preparation skills.)

Step 3: Data Analysis (Python â€“ EDA & RFM Analysis)

I used Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Found seasonal sales patterns, high-demand products, and customer trends.

Then, I applied RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) to segment customers:

High-value loyal customers

At-risk customers (who might churn)

One-time buyers

(This shows analytical and segmentation skills.)

Step 4: Visualization (Power BI Dashboards)

I built interactive dashboards in Power BI to present insights:

Sales trends by time and region.

Customer behavior patterns.

Product performance (best-sellers vs low performers).

Used DAX to create calculated measures like average purchase value, churn probability, and retention rate.

(This highlights your visualization and storytelling skills.)

Step 5: Business Insights & Outcomes

From my analysis, I delivered the following key insights:

Identified customers who were likely to churn, so businesses could target them with promotions.

Highlighted best-selling products that drive revenue.

Suggested strategies for cross-selling and up-selling.

This helped in designing data-driven strategies to boost customer retention and increase revenue.
